/*
## borrow box

### Instructions

You will have to create a **CRUD** functionality. Therefore creating the following functions :

- `create_game`, that receives two players and initializes them with a name and a score. This functions should
  return the structure wrapped in a Box.

- `read_winner`, that receives a game and returns a tuple with the name and the score of the player who is winning.
  In case none of the players are winning, it should return the same tuple with the string "Same score! tied" and the tied score.

- `update_score`, that receives a copy of the owned value (Game) in the box and the name of a player.
  This function should increment the score of the player and return the structure wrapped in a box. The
  score should only be increased if it does not pass the `nbr_of_games`.
  Example: if the nbr_of_games is 3 then the game should be best out of three. So if one play as 2 wins then
  he is the winner and the function should not increase the score anymore for either players.

- `delete`, that takes the ownership of the boxed game and returning a string : "Game deleted: id -> 0".
