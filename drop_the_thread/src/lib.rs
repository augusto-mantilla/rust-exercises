## drop

### Instructions

"Interior mutability is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data"

You must create a Drop checker API. For this you must create:

- Two structures:
  - `Workers` that will have two fields:
    - `drops` that will save the number of dropped threads
    - `states` that will save a state of multiple threads.
      If the thread is not dropped, the state will be false otherwise true.
  - `Thread` that will have the following fields:
    - `pid`, the id of the thread
    - `cmd`, the name of the thread
    - `parent`, that will be the link to the structure `Workers` (Tip: this must be a reference to the structure Workers)

- Implementation of each structure:
  - `Workers` :
    - `new`, that creates a default worker
    - `new_worker`, that returns a tuple with the `pid` and a new `Thread`,
      this function must receive a `String` being the `cmd`
      - `is_dropped`, that receives a `pid` and returns a `bool` that indicates the state of the thread by using the `pid`
      - `track_worker`, it should return a `usize`, that will be the last available index of the `states` vector, being the new next thread
    - `add_drop`, this function must be **called by the `Drop` trait**. It will receive a `pid` that will be used to change the
      state of the thread. If the state of that thread is `true` then it will panic with the message ("Cannot drop {}, because its already dropped", pid).
      Otherwise it should change the state to true and increment the `drops` field by one.

  - `Thread`:
    - `new_thread`, that initializes a new thread
    - `skill`, that drops the thread

- You must implement for the structure `Thread` the `Drop` trait. In this trait you must call the function `add_drop` so that the state of the thread changes
